- Add descriptive README file to your project - please use this template but remember to customize it to your project.
- Add 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
    - A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use h1 tag for that.
    - A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
